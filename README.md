This is a collection of miscellaneous scripts that I've written or modified for my use. Hopefully they may be of some use to others. When I get a chance, I'll try and update this readme with descriptions of all of the scripts.

NOTE: Some of these are over a decade old, and probably useless at this point. Please look at the commit date/history and use your judgment.
